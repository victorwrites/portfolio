## About Me

I’m Victor Hernandez, a technical writer with a background in military systems, compliance, and structured content design.

After 14 years in the U.S. Army, I transitioned into professional documentation, specializing in clear, actionable guides for safety-critical industries.

I’m passionate about improving user understanding, minimizing operational errors, and building systems that empower the people who rely on them.
